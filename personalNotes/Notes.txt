1] Don't forget to use -lpthread -pthread flags for compiling

2] CLARIFY RECURMUTEX UNLOCK FUNCTION - how to decide # locks for #globals
3] DISCUSS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SIGNAL AND BROADCAST
4] SEEMS LIKE I AM HAVING TO USE CONDITION VARIABLES TO IMPLEMENT CONDITION VARIABLES
    - should i be using sem_wait and post and spin lock protections instead?

cond wait working with recurnotes
change into classes to make it possible to create multiple of them
encase tid and count into one structure and one lock for the entire structure

// ANSWER START

// NOTE:
// i have used two different mutex for tid and count
// this only benefits unlock however since thats the only place the two are not read togher
// both locking functions have to consider count irrespective of tid mathcing or not

// it might be possible to use @currThreadID = -1 to signal that lock is free to be acquired
// in this case it acts as the mutex to be utilized for condition variables

// it does not seem to be the case but think about whether these functions must be atomic
// ANSWER END
