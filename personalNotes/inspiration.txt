* I remember while doing the threading project on banking I was not comfortable with the fact
that I could not call different class methods since it would have messed up logging
* It felt like a small problem at the time since the duplication of code was relatively small
* However, I started to think about longer code segments and through that it would not be extendable

* I started to think about it more and realized for transfer to still be atomic and not permit context switches
* I would have to lock at the start of transfer, call deposit and withdraw and then release lock
* However since withdraw and deposit will also try to acquire the locks it would lead to deadlocks
* I researched a bit on how one can counter this and came across recursive locks

* It turns out that recursive locks have already been implemented - attr specifier for pthread_init
* Thus i thought that making a project implementing that would be interesting.
