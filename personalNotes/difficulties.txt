Having locks for each variable one common one
Having recursive works work with pthread_cond_wait()
should i go for unordered map or stick to lists for ease of use
for what scope should i change handler of SIGUSR1 to do nothing of importance
how should i check if a thread is sleeping wo forcing studenets to create public values

which signals to block and which to not
when should you unblock them
could you ignore all signals (except SIGUSR1) before sleeping and later on switch them back to default
this assumes that if one signal is delivered than all must be

deciding to use sigusr2 as well for testing???


* Seems to be the case that sigwaitinfo gets interrupted by other singals as well
* Seems to be the case that pthread_cond_wait gets interrupted by other signals as well
* but i want to test that a thread has actually gone to sleep until SIGUSR1 received

* that does not seem possible however
* instead have a handler for all signals that just sets a global variable to the signal received
* and keep sigwait until the global variable changes to SIGUSR1
* but this disregards other important sigkills that should generally not be ignored
