Some Important Decisions to take while finalizing structure

1] Should students think of the header changes themselves or should we give it to them?
2] Should we enforce opaqueness of pthread_t and how can we achieve this?
3] Might want students to define structs in the c file instead of the header for autograder??
4] Ratio of Manual to Autograded component 


Testing:

-Students using == instead of pthread_equal
-forgetting to increment count correctly
-forgetting to correctly lock and unlock resulting in deadlocks or other side
-using if instead of while loop
-not acquiring mutex if told to wait on it
